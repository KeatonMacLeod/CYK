Hello!

The program I have implemented uses the CYK algorithm, a dynamic programming strategy,
in order to figure out if a given string can be generated by the grammar supplied by the
user. You will have seen this algorithm upon taking a course related to Automata Theory
and Formal Languages.


How It Works:
-------------

1.) The program uses a hash table in order to store all of the variables that
	generate the given variable/terminal. This provides O(1) search time within
	the table which is extremely efficient.

2.) By using the CYK Algorithm's strategy, the table that you will commonly see used
	in the algorithm is built by checking which of the strings can be generated by the 
	given variables in the system.
	
3.) After the final Cell has been filled in, the program checks to see if the start variable 
	is in the final Cell, and if it is, the string can be generated.
	
How To Use The Program:
-----------------------

1.) Input your grammar as specified by the example input.

2.) Input yout output string to be generated by your grammar. 

3.) Input the start variable of your grammar.

4.) Click "Check Output" upon entering the data to receive a result.
